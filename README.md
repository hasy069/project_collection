Small/Medium pet projects to copy paste when needed later

Update(19.07.2025, 16:16) Added a new loop allowing ore downloads from binance without triggering the rate limiter, hope this works, runs currently
                          Additionally: Will eventually code a custom backtester than can use Market data Input and execute orders

Update (02.09.2025, 21:10) Added a better version of the CNN to implement eventually in my (gatekept) Market Making Infrastructure (no it works not great, it is just to build actual infrastructure :)) )
